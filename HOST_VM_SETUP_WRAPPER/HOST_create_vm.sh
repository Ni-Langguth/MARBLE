After executing this script, the following steps must be performed manually: \n
\t - Register the VM to the CERN network at https://landb.cern.ch/portal/devices/register \n
\t\t  - mac-address: $(prlctl list -i ${VM_NAME} | grep net | sed -n 's/.*mac=\([^ ]*\).*/\1/p') \n
\t\t  - name: ${VM_NAME} \n
\t\t  - opt out of IPV6, it can lead to problems \n
\t - Go through apples setup assistant in the VMs GUI, selecting: \n
\t\t  - Language: English \n
\t\t  - Select your country or region: Switzerland \n
\t\t  - Dictation (should be preset with region): English (United States) \n
\t\t  - Input Sources (should be preset with region): U.S., Swiss German, Swiss French, Italian \n
\t\t  - Preferred Languages (should be preset with region): English (US), German, French, Italian \n
\t\t  - Migration Assistant / Transfer data to this mac: Not now / Set up as new \n
\t\t  - Accessibility: Not Now \n
\t\t  - Data & Privacy - Continue \n
\t\t  - Create a Computer Account \n
\t\t\t  - Full name: sftnight \n
\t\t\t  - Account name: sftnight \n
\t\t\t  - Password: (the usual one for root or SPIâ€¦) \n 
\t\t  - Sign In with Your Apple ID: Set up later \n
\t\t  - Terms and Conditions: Agree \n
\t\t  - Enable Location Services: continue without enabling \n
\t\t  - Select your time zone: Geneva - Switzerland \n
\t\t  - Analytics: disable/click off any boxes and continue \n
\t\t  - Screen Time: Set up later \n
\t\t  - Siri: disable and continue \n
\t\t  - Update mac automatically : continue \n
\t - The following settings must be configured manually: \n
\t\t - Lock Screen must be set to 'Never' in these three options: \n
\t\t\t  - Start screen Saver when inactive : Never \n
\t\t\t  - Turn display off when inactive : Never \n
\t\t\t  - Require password after screen saver begins or display is turned off : Never \n
\t\t - Sharing must be enabled (at the very bottom of the 'Sharing' settings page): \n
\t\t\t  - Enable Remote Management (enable all sub-options of Remote-Management after clicking the little 'i' icon, do not set a password) \n
\t\t\t  - Enable Remote Login (select 'All users', instead of 'Only these users') \n
\t - .ipsw files are not always available for the latest macos version, check for updates BEFORE trying to install xcode or it will install the wrong version \n
\n
Once the registration of the network mac-address is finished: \n
\t - restart the VM \n
\t - run this line from the host-mac to confirm that the VM is ready to be sshed to: \n
\t\t ssh $VM_NAME 'echo test' \n
\t - log into the GUI and run this next line from the host-mac to install xcode: \n
\t\t ssh $VM_NAME 'xcode-select --install' \n
\t - check the spreadsheet whether the correct version of xcode was installed for that OS version. \n
\t - Use the sft Apple ID to download the correct version of xcode from https://developer.apple.com/download/all/ \n
\t - log into the GUI and run this next line from the host-mac to install the parallels-toolbox: \n
\t\t prlctl installtools $VM_NAME \n
\t - use the GUI to accept the license-agreement and go through with the toolbox installation. \n
\t - restart the VM once the installations are finished, then move on to the HOST_<YOUR_TEAM>_configure.sh \n
